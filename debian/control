Description: low-level image manipulation library - header files
 The MagickCore API is a low-level interface between the C programming language
 and the ImageMagick image processing libraries and is recommended for
 wizard-level programmers only. Unlike the MagickWand C API which uses only a
 few opaque types and accessors, with MagickCore you almost exclusively access
 the structure members directly.

Description: image manipulation programs -- quantum depth Q16
 ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images.
 It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100)
 including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript,
 SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
 shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special
 effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier curves.
 All manipulations can be achieved through shell commands as well as through
 an X11 graphical interface (display).
 .
 For working with the SVG, WMF, OpenEXR, DjVu and Graphviz formats,
 you need to install the libmagickcore-6.q16-2-extra package.
 .
 This version of imagemagick is compiled for a channel
 depth of 16 bits (Q16).
